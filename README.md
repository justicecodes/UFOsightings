# UFOsightings

## Overview of Project: 
The goal of this project was to create a responsive webpage displaying a table of UFO sightings. The table accepts user input to filter the table by location, date, and type and display relevant UFO sighting results. 

## Results:

Home screen of webpage when opened. Click the white UFO Sightings link in the top left of the screen to refresh and reset the table.

The user can select any of the following filters to search for specific results within the table: date(m/d/yyyy), city (all lowercase), state (lowercase abbreviation), country (lowercase abbreviation), or shape (triangle, circle, light, chevron, unknown, fireball, formation, disk, sphere, changing, oval, other)

You can filter the table by entering input into one category, then clicking the "Filter" button below.

Or, you can filter the table by entering multiple categories at once.

Remember to clear the filters by clicking the white "UFO Sightings" link in the top left of the page. 

## Summary: 
- One drawback of this design is that it is difficult for the user to know exactly what to type in order for the filters to work. The input should be edited to allow capital or lowercase spellings of each filter. In the date entry, edits should be made to allow for zeros before the month or day, or for two numbers for the year instead of four
- Further development of the webpage should include more data (current data only shows dates 1/1/2010-1/13/2010 and only sightings in the US)
- Further development should also show a key of what inputs are suggested for different categories (ie types of sighting shapes to choose from)
- Users would benefit from each location result in the table being a link taking them to Google Maps or another mapping website to pinpoint where the UFO was seen
